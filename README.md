# Code_quiz

## Description 

This project is a multiple choice timed quiz game using javaScript. You should start off the game by reading the directions and clicking the start button. In doing so, you should be aware that the timer will start once you click the start button. You will be prompted with a series of questions and multiple choice answers. If you answer a question incorrectly the timer will deduct 10 seconds. Your final score is calculated by the time left on the timer. After, you will be able to submit your score to gauge your knowledge compared to your peers.
